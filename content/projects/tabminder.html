__Tools & skills:__ Javascript, localstorage, Chrome extension development

Tabminder is my first serious Javascript project. It's a simple Chrome extension designed to make me more mindful when I vist distracting sites. By providing a gentle reminder every few minutes, it prevents quick visits to time-wasting sites from running too long. 

Open a distracting tab, and Tabminder starts counting down from your preset time limit. When time's up, it will prompt you to close the tab or restart the timer. This is just annoying enough to intercept distracted browsing, but not so strict that it prevents you from checking on Reddit or HN once in a while. (You deserve that little break, right?)

I learned Javascript to write Tabminder. I also learned all about Chrome extension development, using localstorage, and message passing. This extension is available from the Chrome web store.
