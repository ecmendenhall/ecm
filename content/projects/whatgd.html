__[Project](http://what.gd)__ | __[Source](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/What-Good)__

__Tools & Skills:__ Python, Django, git

What.gd was my first serious Python application, my first Django project, and the first time I used version control. It was inspired by Kevin Kelly's It was inspired by Benjamin Franklin's [daily questions](http://flowingdata.com/2011/03/20/daily-schedule-of-benjamin-franklin/) and Kevin Kelly's [life countdown](http://kk.org/ct2/2007/09/my-life-countdown-1.php).
