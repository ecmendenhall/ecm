__Tools & Skills:__ Python, Tumblr API, Flickr API

Evolution creates complex things from just three simple rules: selection, replication, and variation. I made Meme Pool as a small experiment to explore this idea. It's a Tumblr blog powered by a simple Python script that uses a genetic algorithm to "evolve" new images to post each day. I wrote it to learn a little bit about JSON and to practice interacting with the Tumblr and Flickr APIs. It runs automatically a few times each day as a cron job on Google App Engine. It's not related to the [other](http://memepool.com/), much more famous memepool.
