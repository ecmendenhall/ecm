Evolution creates amazing and complex things from just three simple rules: selection, replication, and variation. I made Meme Pool as a small experiment to explore this idea. This Python code powers a Tumblr blog that "evolves" new images to post each day. I wrote it to learn a little bit about JSON and to practice interacting with an API. You can see the blog here.
