__Tools & skills:__ Python, Google App Engine, memcached, AJAX, JQuery, BeautifulSoup, Tweepy, Twitter Bootstrap

After watching a few friends freak out about meeting their funding goals in the last few hours of their Kickstarter campaigns, I made this simple web application to help find and save struggling Kickstarter projects. Kicksaver crawls and curates the Ending Soon and Small Projects categories on Kickstarter a few times a day to find projects that will close soon. 

The backend is written in Python using the Google App Engine webapp2 framework. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse Kickstarter projects, and Tweepy to publish endangered projects to Twitter a few times each day. The frontend uses JQuery for asynchronous updates and CSS styles from Twitter Bootstrap.
